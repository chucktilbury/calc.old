# Calc
Command line interactive calculator. This small program is intended to be a useful CLI calculator, but it's also intended to be a test bed for learning how to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using a Bison parser. It is basiclaly a very simple tree-walking interpreter. It should build and run anywhere GCC is available. It depends on the GNU Readline library, Bison, and Flex.
